# About Me

I am a student at Toronto Metropolitan University.

The name of the blog comes from a common error in the Python programming language relating to [recursive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science).  

This is supposed to be funny because I'm writing about thoughts that I can't keep in my head.
