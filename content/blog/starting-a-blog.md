description: My decision to start a blog and talk about things I find interesting.

**S**tarting a blog has always been an interesting concept to me, mainly because a lot of frontend/fullstack projects you see online are “build a blog with me” or something, and then I never quite understood what I wanted to write about in the first place. 

So, I’m going to start out very clear with this post: this blog is going to be about the thoughts I have about interesting concepts I learn in class or find on my own time. Hopefully I can post every 2 weeks or at least once a month, but I’ll see how I’m feeling and go off of that.

The most interesting class I’m taking right now is called [Discrete Structures](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~cps420/), which explores a bunch of interesting stuff including Sequences, Graphs and Finite Automata. This is honestly my main inspiration for the content of this blog as there are so many interesting problems introduced in lecture slides that I rarely ever pay attention to.

I’m also taking a course called Comparative Programming Languages which emphasizes the use of functional programming and other programming paradigms, so in the spirit of that whole course I’m going to try to provide examples in multiple languages if I include any code snippets.

Other than that, I might write about other interesting thoughts relating to computer stuff or my configurations and code editor stuff for various languages
